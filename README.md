# Logo_detection-with-YoloV7

This repository is meant to help people with who want to build an end-to-end Logo Detection + Recognition system. 

All you need to build this is for a small sized logo dataset(5-10 images/Logo class is more than sufficient!), and a little bit of effort. No training required!

For more details please read this article to on how this system works and build it yourself :

You can try out the Logo detector yourself, here's a demo of the Universal Logo Detector hosted on my hugging face :

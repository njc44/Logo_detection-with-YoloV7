# Logo_detection-with-YoloV7

This repository is meant to help people with who want to build an end-to-end Logo Detection + Recognition system given they only need a small sized logo dataset they need to detect for their use case. This dataset will be used for our Recognition(retrival) step.

Please read this article to get a detailed explaination on how it this system works : https://medium.com/@nathanjjacob/how-to-build-a-logo-detection-recognition-system-at-scale-c2b094ae4fd2

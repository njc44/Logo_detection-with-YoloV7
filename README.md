# Logo_detection-with-YoloV7

This repository is meant to help people with who want to build an end-to-end Logo Detection + Recognition system. The only requirement is for a small sized logo dataset(5-10 images/Logo class is more than sufficient!) they need to detect for their use case. This dataset will be used for our Recognition(retrival) step, for more details please read this article to on how this system works :
